Hi, I'm Rik! 👋
🚀 Sysadmin & Tech Enthusiast
With a strong background in M365, Azure, and information security, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems.

💡 Curious & Eager Learner
Always exploring new technologies and methodologies, I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to grow and expand my skill set. I’m currently diving deeper into Bash, Terraform and Docker.

📜 Volunteering
When I'm not coding or exploring new tech, I volunteer at an archaeological museum, merging my love for history with technology. This experience helps me maintain a balanced and productive work rhythm.

🏋️‍♂️ Fun Fact
Staying active is essential for me, and I make it a point to hit the gym at least twice a week to keep my energy levels high!

Let’s collaborate and create something amazing together!
